Documents (Word, PDF, Google Docs)**\n- **Insert Content**: Add text, images, or tables using the toolbar.\n- **Use Templates**: Apply pre-designed templates for consistency.\n- **Export**: Save as a PDF or Word document for sharing.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Blogs (WordPress, Blogger, Medium)**\n- **Write a Post**: Use the editor to draft text, add images, or embed videos.\n- **Add Metadata**: Include tags, titles, or descriptions for SEO.\n- **Publish**: Share the post via the \"Publish\" button.\n\n---\n\n### **5.

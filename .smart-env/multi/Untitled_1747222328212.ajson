Websites (CMS Platforms like WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace)**\n- **Create a Page**: Use the CMS editor to add text, images, or videos.\n- **Use a WYSIWYG Editor**: Drag and drop content (text, images, videos) into a page.\n- **Add Media**: Upload images, videos, or audio files via the media library.\n- **Publish**: Click \"Publish\" or \"Share\" to make content visible.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Social Media Platforms (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok)**\n- **Post Content**: Use the post editor to add text, images, or videos.\n- **Add Stories**: Create a story with text, images, or videos using the story editor.\n- **Use Hashtags**: Add relevant hashtags for visibility.\n- **Schedule Posts**: Plan content for later using the scheduling feature.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Documents (Word, PDF, Google Docs)**\n- **Insert Content**: Add text, images, or tables using the toolbar.\n- **Use Templates**: Apply pre-designed templates for consistency.\n- **Export**: Save as a PDF or Word document for sharing.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Blogs (WordPress, Blogger, Medium)**\n- **Write a Post**: Use the editor to draft text, add images, or embed videos.\n- **Add Metadata**: Include tags, titles, or descriptions for SEO.\n- **Publish**: Share the post via the \"Publish\" button.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Video Platforms (YouTube, Vimeo)**\n- **Upload Video**: Use the upload tool to add videos.\n- **Add Text/Descriptions**: Add captions or subtitles using the editor.\n- **Add Music**: Insert background music via the media library.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Adding Content**\n- **Use Simple Tools**: Drag-and-drop editors (e.g., Canva for design).\n- **Check Platform Guidelines**: Follow specific instructions for each platform.\n- **Organize Content**: Use folders, tags, or categories to manage large volumes of content.\n\nLet me know the specific context (e.g., website, social media, document) if you'd like tailored steps! üåê‚ú®"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0}}},"messages":{"user-1-1747222395062-1":1,"assistant-2-1747222398288-1":2},"branches":{},"class_name":"SmartThread2","key":"Untitled 1747222328212"},
